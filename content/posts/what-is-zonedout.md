## What is ZonedOut ?

**Zonedout** aims to be a blog about multiple categories including but not limited to *technology*, *travel*, *food* and *life in general!*

We are using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/ "The world’s fastest framework for building websites | Hugo") to build the blog, [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions "Features • GitHub Actions • Automate your workflow from idea to production") to build and deploy, [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/ "GitHub Pages | Websites for you and your projects, hosted directly from your GitHub repository. Just edit, push, and your changes are live.") to host it and [TinaCMS](https://tina.io/ "The Markdown CMS | Tina") to manage it.
